      <h1>What is tobacco use?</h1>
      <p>Smoking involves the burning of a substance with the use of conventional cigarettes, cigars or a pipe. Cigarettes being the most common to be consumed, they will be mainly used to explain smoking.</p>
      <p>Some of the substances that can be burned include tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, heroin and opium. However, the most commonly consumed substance is tobacco, which will be primarily discussed to define smoking here.</p>
      
      <h1>What is in tobacco?</h1>
      <p>There are more than 7,000 chemicals in tobacco, more than 70 of which are carcinogens, meaning they can cause cancer. Some of the contents of tobacco come from the plant itself, while others are added. These include nicotine, arsenic and compounding agents.</p>
      <p>Nicotine is a chemical that attaches to the brain and alters its function by stimulating the production of dopamine. It is not carcinogenic, but is the main culprit in tobacco addiction. Often, manufacturers add nicotine to tobacco to make consumers more addicted to the product.</p>
      <p>Arsenic is a toxic and highly carcinogenic substance. The reason it is present in tobacco is because it is used in pesticides and plants absorb the substance.</p>
      <p>Compositional agents include texture, preservatives and flavouring agents. They are very often added in tobacco by manufacturers, because they improve various aspects of the practice in various ways: softening the irritation of the smoke, dilating the airways and maintaining the moisture of the tobacco. All of this serves to make the product more attractive for consumption, thus increasing the risk of addiction.</p>
      
      <h1>How does someone become addicted to nicotine?</h1>
      <p>When smoking for the first time, there is a quick feeling of energy and pleasure. This is caused by a release of adrenaline from the brain when the nicotine reaches that organ. When the effect wears off, one may feel tired and down, and want to relive what they felt.</p>
      <p>Since our bodies are able to develop a high tolerance to nicotine, one will require a higher dose of the same product to feel what they felt the first time, which could lead to an endless cycle in search of the first sensation.</p>
      <p>Since our brains develop until the age of 25, nicotine use in adolescents and young adults can lead to lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments, especially with memory, concentration and learning. This substance causes specific changes in the brain, making it more vulnerable to chronic use of illegal drugs (cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamines, hallucinogens, heroin, etc.).</p>

      <h1>What are the effects of smoking?</h1>
      <p>When tobacco is burned, several substances are released. These include cadmium, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, benzene, tar, etc. These various products affect our bodies in different ways:</p>      
      <p>Cadmium, present in batteries and dyes, causes yellowing of teeth, and loss of taste and smell in smokers.</p>
      <p>Hydrogen cyanide, used in pesticides and plastics, is found in tobacco smoke. It damages the airways, making the lungs more vulnerable to infection.</p>      
      <p>Ammonia, very harmful, increases the risk of nicotine addiction by promoting its absorption by the body. </p>
      <p>Benzene, found in gasoline, glues and pesticides, causes cancer by altering the DNA of cells it penetrates.</p>     
      <p>Tar, used primarily to pave streets, also causes yellowing of teeth and leaves blackish deposits in the lungs of smokers.</p>
      <p>In addition to the effects on the human body, cigarettes and the industry associated with it have consequences for the environment. Indeed, each stage of the tobacco life cycle has adverse consequences for the environment.</p>
      <p>All tobacco activities (production, consumption and disposal) release 80 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Its production consumes 22 billion tons of water; its consumption produces 2 million tons of packaging waste; the accommodation of land for tobacco cultivation is responsible for 5% of global deforestation with the shaving of nearly 200,000 hectares of land per year; a single cigarette butt pollutes nearly 100 L of water and nearly 4.5 trillion of these cigarette butts are thrown away annually.</p>
